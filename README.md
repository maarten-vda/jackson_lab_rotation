This is a GitHub repository for all of the scripts used in the protein-protein interaction prediction pipeline. 
Pipeline.sh is the main script, taking lists of proteins in various formats as an input, returning a ranked list of predicted interactors. 
This pipeline was designed to be used on Eddie, a cluster computer running the Univa Gridengine batch submission system.
